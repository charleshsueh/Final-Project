# EEG Eye State Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques

This repository contains the final project for DS4Ling by Chun-chien Hsueh.  
The project explores machine learning models for classifying eye states (open or closed) using EEG data.

## Paper
The full report can be found in [`paper.pdf`](./paper.pdf).


## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

## Feature Engineering
- Oversampling (to handle imbalance)
- LASSO and Random Forest feature selection
- Domain-specific interaction terms

## Results
- **SVM** achieved the best performance:
  - Accuracy: 94.6%
  - AUC: 0.982
- McNemar's test showed SVM, MLP, and kNN performed similarly (p > 0.05), while logistic regression performed significantly worse (p < 0.001).

## Dataset
Data: [UCI EEG Eye State Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/264/eeg+eye+state)
